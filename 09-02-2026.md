# Feb 9, 2026 Code Changes (Short Brief)

## Core Update
- We refactored the project from fixed, one-time input into a reusable card manager with dynamic memory and file persistence.
- The program now supports a full loop: load cards, list/add/delete, and save back to disk.

## File Changes
- `src/main.c`: Replaced the old flow with a 6-option menu loop (list, add, delete, save, save+exit, exit). Added safer `fgets`-based input checks for non-empty values and valid non-negative numbers.
- `src/card_store.h` and `src/card_store.c`: Added storage/persistence module with `ensure_capacity(...)`, `find_card_index_by_name(...)`, `readCardsFromFile(...)`, and `writeCardsToFile(...)`. Handles `name|type|hit_points|dollar_value` lines and skips malformed rows safely.
- `src/card_accessors.h` and `src/card_accessors.c`: Kept getters/setters and added required formatting functions `toString(...)` and `getToStringLength(...)` for clean card display.
- `src/pokemon_card.h`: Added compatibility alias `typedef PokemonCard RecordStructure;` so assignment-required signatures work without changing the core struct.
- `src/Makefile`: Updated link step to include `card_store.o` with `main.o` and `card_accessors.o` when building `february5`.

## Quick Build Check
- `make clean && make february5`

## Team Takeaway
- We now have a cleaner modular design: UI/input in `main`, storage/file logic in `card_store`, and formatting/accessors in `card_accessors`.
- This version is easier to maintain, test, and extend than the original fixed-size implementation.
